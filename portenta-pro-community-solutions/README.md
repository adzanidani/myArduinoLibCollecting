Note: All tinyMqtt code has been adapted for the Portenta from https://github.com/hsaturn/TinyMqtt


## Install from the Arduino IDE library manager --> search for "Portenta", then install the "Portenta Pro Coummnity Solutions"

Install it as a standalone or with the few supporting libraries. Either way works fine.

## Goal
